# ComCloneV3 BP
Partyline Intercom Clone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this Project is a remake of the ComClone2 from RCROWLEY.com 
it works with the Partyline Intercom Systems from AXXENT, Clearcom, an other Partyline Systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did some Changes like adding a flashing circuit for the LED and also deleting/adding some un-/necessary Components from the PCB.
I also redisigned the PCB so you can order it from a pcb manufacturer with the gerber files.

The Calculated Cost for 1 Beltpack are around 35â‚¬ for Parts and a Custom PCB ordered from China.
